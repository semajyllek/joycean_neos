## joycean_neos

This is a small repo which shows the code used to build and maintain the twitter account @JoyNeos
which generates neologisms in the style of James Joyce' Ulysses using nltk and POS modelling.

- see notebook for full construction code
- new tweets are generated **Thursdays at 0600** in whatever timezone I'm in, 
  from random combinations of tags from `neo_tags.json` combined with lemmatized English words in `english_words.txt`
